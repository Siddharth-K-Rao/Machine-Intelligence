## Assignment 1 - Decision Tree Classifier
Decision Trees are one of the easiest and popular classification algorithms to understand and
interpret. The goal of using a Decision Tree is to create a training model that can be used to
predict the class or value of the target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from
prior data.
The primary challenge in the decision tree implementation is to identify which attributes to
consider as the root node at each level. Handling this is known as attribute selection.
The ID3 algorithm builds decision trees using a top-down greedy search approach through the
space of possible branches with no backtracking. It always makes the choice that seems to be the
best at that moment.
Attribute selection in the ID3 algorithm involves various steps such as computing entropy,
information gain and selecting the most appropriate attribute as the root node.

In this assignment we are given functions that calculate all these important parameters that help
in construction of a categorical variable decision tree.

## Assignment 2 - Search Algorithms
Search Algorithms aim at navigating from a start state to a goal state by transitioning through
intermediate states. It also consists of a state space which is a set of all possible states where
you can be.
There are many informed and uninformed search algorithms that exist and are very popular.
A* search, Uniform Cost search (UCS), Depth First Search (DFS), Greedy Search to name a
few.

In this assignment we are given a function called tri_traversal which implements three main
algorithms which are A* search, Uniform Cost Search (UCS), Depth First Search (DFS).
